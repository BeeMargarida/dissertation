%\chapter*{Agradecimentos}

There is a big number of people that made it possible for me to finish my \textit{Master's Degree} and this dissertation.

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors Hugo Sereno Ferreira and André Restivo, who guided me through the dissertation while supplying knowledge and insights that improved my knowledge and work. I also appreciated the electronics lessons given which might have created my new hobby. I would also like to thank João Pedro Dias for the insights and suggestions given, which greatly improved the final work.

I would like to thank my friends, who supported me through all this time and provided the best quality jokes for me to laugh about. A special thanks to my \textit{dissertation budies} from \textit{IoTices}, who always listened to my ramblings and provided support and companionship. 

To Pedro Reis, my boyfriend, for putting up with my many moods, motivating me, and reminding me when I needed to rest.

Lastly, a huge thank you to my parents and brother, who supported me through all my life and pushed me to be the best I can be.
