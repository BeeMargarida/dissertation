\section{Context} \label{sec:context}

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm states that all devices, independently of their capabilities, are connected to the Internet and allow for the transfer, integration and analytic of data generated by them~\cite{IoT_principles_and_paradigms}. This paradigm has several characteristics, such as the heterogeneity and high distribution of devices as well as their increasing connectivity and computational capabilities~\cite{SoS}. All these factors allow for a great level of applicability, enabling the realization of systems for the management of cities, health services, and industries ~\cite{6851114}.

The interest in Internet-of-Things has been growing massively, following the rising of connected devices along these past years. According to Siemens, in 2020 there will be around 26 billion physical devices connected to the Internet and in 2025 the predictions are pointing at 75 billion~\cite{tanweer}. Although this allows for more opportunities, it is important to note that these devices are very different in their hardware and capabilities, which causes several problems in terms of developing the systems, as well as their scalability, maintainability, and security. 

Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) allow the user to communicate with the system by using and arranging visual elements that can be translated into code~\cite{vpl-book}. It provides the user with an intuitive and straightforward interface for coding at the possible cost of losing functionality. There are several programming languages with different focuses, such as education, video game development, 3D building, system design, and even Internet-of-Things~\cite{survey_vpl_iot}. Node-RED\footnote{https://nodered.org/} is one of the most famous open-source visual programming tools, originally developed by IBMâ€™s Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the JS Foundation, which provides an environment for users to develop their own Internet-of-Things systems.

Non-functional attributes in a system are very important, specially attributes such as resiliency, fault-tolerance, and self-healing in Internet-of-Things systems. All these attributes mean that when an error or problem occurs, the system can adapt and overcome them dynamically and automatically.

Node-RED, mentioned above, is a centralized system, as well as most of the visual programming environments applied to IoT. A centralized architecture has a central instance that executes all computational tasks on the data provided by the other devices in the network. On the other hand, in a decentralized architecture the central instance, if it exists, partitions the computational tasks in independent blocks that can be executed by other devices. In IoT, these decentralized architectures are mentioned in Fog and Edge computing.

\section{Problem Definition} \label{sec:problem_definition}

Most mainstream visual programming tools focused on Internet-of-Things, Node-RED included, have a centralized approach, where the main component executes most of the computation on data provided by edge devices, e.g. sensors and gateways. There are several consequences to this approach: (a)~computation capabilities of the edge devices are being ignored, (b)~it introduces a single point of failure, and (c)~local data is being transferred across boundaries (private, technological, political...) either without need or even in violation of legal constraints. The principle of Local-First~\cite{localfist} - i.e, data and logic should reside locally, independent of third-party services faults and errors - and NoCloud~\cite{nocloud} - i.e, on-device and local computation should be prioritized over cloud service computation - is being ignored. 

Besides being a single point of failure, centralized systems can be less efficient than decentralized ones and in this context, it might be the case, since there are computation capabilities that aren't being taken advantage of.

Chapter \ref{chap:problem_statement} expands on the problem definition, explaining it in bigger detail, defining its scope, desiderata, use cases and research questions.

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}

Internet-of-Things is a rapidly growing concept that is being applied to several areas, such as home automation, industry, health, city management, and many others. Given the number of existing systems with different protocols and architectures, it becomes difficult for a user to build a system that is in accordance with standards~\cite{standard-iot}. 

With the appearance of visual programming languages focused in IoT, more specifically Node-RED, users can build their own systems in an easier and streamlined way, removing the overhead of learning advanced programming concepts and protocols. These tools must be resilient, in order to withstand flaws and non-availability of devices as well as failure in the network. However, the majority of these tools are centralized, including Node-RED, and this type of architecture hinders the resiliency of the system. Given the existence of only one unit that executes most or all the processing of data, if this device fails, the system becomes nonfunctional. A possible solution would be increasing the redundancy of the system, creating more than one instance of the main unit. However, this approach has several costs, not only monetary but also in the increase in complexity.

\section{Goals} \label{sec:goals}

The main goal of this dissertation is to leverage the computation capabilities of the devices in the network, increasing efficiency, fault-tolerance, resiliency and scalability in an Internet-of-Things system.

To achieve this goal, a prototype will be developed, extending or rewriting Node-RED, which enables IoT devices to communicate their "computational capabilities" back to the orchestrator. In its turn, the orchestrator is able to partition the computation and send "tasks" to the nodes, which are the devices in the network, leveraging their computation power and independence.

As a secondary goal, several other challenges will be tackled, viz: (i)~computational capabilities of the devices in the network, (ii)~detecting non-availability and using alternative computation resources, and (iii)~exploring different alternatives of leveraging current IoT devices, including using firmwares that allow the execution of programs written in Lua, Javascript, Python, etc., amongst others.
